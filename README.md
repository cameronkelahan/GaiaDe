# GaiaDetect
Input a known exoplanet via its Gaia-ID to produce a heat map displaying Gaia's sensitivity to detect that planet across possible masses of the planet and orbital semi-major axes.

Functionality:
- Input Gaia-ID (or Tic-ID?) of a known exoplanet
    - Accepts a single ID, a list of ID's, or a .csv or .txt fole with a list of IDs
- produce sensitivity plot of gaia's ability to detect said planet across a 2D space defined by the planets mass and semi-major axis (since these are most likely not known)
